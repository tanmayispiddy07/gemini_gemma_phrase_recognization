# Phrase Generation using Gemini 2bit Model

This project demonstrates the use of the **Gemini 2bit model** for phrase generation tasks. The model is trained on tweet data and evaluated on multiple test files, including a zero-shot test file. The tokenizer used is **`AutoTokenizer`** from Hugging Face.

## Gemma Overview

The goal of this project is to generate relevant phrases based on tweet data using the **Gemini 2bit model**. The model has been evaluated on two tasks:
1. **Stance Detection**: Identifying the stance of the tweet towards a given target.
2. **Target Generation**: Generating the target (or topic) based on the tweet content.

The evaluation results for both tasks have been evaluated on several datasets, showcasing the model's performance, including zero-shot tasks.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics for both tasks:

### Stance Detection
- **Case 1**: 78% accuracy
- **Case 2**: 78% accuracy
- **Zero-shot**: 60% accuracy

### Target Generation
- **Case 1**: 78% accuracy
- **Case 2**: 79% accuracy
- **Zero-shot**: 64% accuracy

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability of the **Gemini 2bit model** to generate relevant phrases based on tweet data. It shows strong performance across both stance detection and target generation tasks. The zero-shot evaluation results highlight the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
